# css_cheatsheet_project

## Description
This project was designed to have us build a responsive 
website with a grid layout and exciting animations, 
that showcases more complicated CSS code that you can 
copy directly to your clipboard and use these specific 
design features in your own code!
This website is a useful resource to update and look back 
on as you continue to learn and grow your more advanced 
coding skills.
